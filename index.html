                <h1>About diabetes</h1>
                <p>Diabetes is a chronic health condition characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar) resulting from the body's inability to produce enough insulin or effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar and allows cells to use glucose for energy.</p>

                <h1>Symptoms</h1>
               <p>Symptoms of diabetes include
                * increased thirst and urination
                * increased hunger
                * fatigue
                * blurred vision
                * numbness or tingling in the feet or hands
                * sores that do not heal
                * unexplained weight loss
                Symptoms of type 1 diabetes can start quickly, in a matter of weeks. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly—over the course of several years—and can be so mild that you might not even notice them. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms. Some people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes-related health problems, such as blurred vision or heart trouble.
                What causes type 1 diabetes?
                
                Type 1 diabetes occurs when your immune system, the body’s system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease. Studies such as TrialNet External link are working to pinpoint causes of type 1 diabetes and possible ways to prevent or slow the disease.
                What causes type 2 diabetes?
                Type 2 diabetes—the most common form of diabetes—is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.
                Overweight, obesity, and physical inactivity
                You are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are not physically active and are overweight or have obesity. Extra weight sometimes causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and heart and blood vessel disease. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these Body Mass Index (BMI) charts.
                Insulin resistance
                Type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which muscle, liver, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can’t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.
                Genes and family history
                As in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.
                Genes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person’s tendency to become overweight or have obesity.
                What causes gestational diabetes?
                Scientists believe gestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.
                Insulin resistance
                Hormones produced by the placenta NIH external link contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas can’t make enough insulin.
                As with type 2 diabetes, extra weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or have obesity may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.
                
                Hormonal changes, extra weight, and family history can contribute to gestational diabetes.
                Genes and family history
                Having a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Genes may also explain why the disorder occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asians, and Hispanics/Latinas.
                What else can cause diabetes?
                
                Genetic mutations NIH external link, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.
                Genetic mutations
                * Monogenic diabetes is caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These changes are usually passed through families, but sometimes the gene mutation happens on its own. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by making the pancreas less able to make insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Neonatal diabetes occurs in the first 6 months of life. Doctors usually diagnose MODY during adolescence or early adulthood, but sometimes the disease is not diagnosed until later in life.
                * Cystic fibrosis NIH external link produces thick mucus that causes scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.
                * Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disease is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.
                Hormonal diseases
                Some hormonal diseases cause the body to produce too much of certain hormones, which sometimes cause insulin resistance and diabetes.
                * Cushing’s syndrome occurs when the body produces too much cortisol—often called the “stress hormone.”
                * Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone.
                * Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.
                Damage to or removal of the pancreas
                Pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can all harm the beta cells or make them less able to produce insulin, resulting in diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.
                Medicines
                Sometimes certain medicines can harm beta cells or disrupt the way insulin works. These include
                * niacin, a type of vitamin B3
                * certain types of diuretics, also called water pills
                * anti-seizure drugs
                * psychiatric drugs
                * drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV NIH external link)
                * pentamidine, a drug used to treat a type of pneumonia External link
                * glucocorticoids—medicines used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis NIH external link, asthma NIH external link, lupus NIH external link, and ulcerative colitis
                * anti-rejection medicines, used to help stop the body from rejecting a transplanted organ
                Statins, which are medicines to reduce LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels, can slightly increase the chance that you’ll develop diabetes. However, statins help protect you from heart disease and stroke. For this reason, the strong benefits of taking statins outweigh the small chance that you could develop diabetes.
                If you take any of these medicines and are concerned about their side effects, talk with your doctor.</p>

            <h1>Story Telling</h1>
            <p id="text2">I am Kamar Akkawi, a 25-year-old biochemist and pharmacist assistant who has been living with type 1 diabetes since 2009, when I was just 11 years old. Back then, I experienced frequent bathroom trips and an insatiable appetite for sugary foods, which kept me confined to my home. Concerned about my symptoms, my mother arranged a visit to the pediatrician, where I underwent various medical tests that led to my diagnosis of type 1 diabetes on November 16, 2009, two days after International Diabetes Day. This news came as a shock to my parents. I spent a week in the hospital taking insulin injections and monitoring my blood sugar levels, all while adjusting to a sugar-free diet. The taste of unsweetened tea remains a vivid memory from that time.

                Upon my pediatrician's recommendation, I attended a appointment at the Chronic Care Centre, a specialized facility for children with type 1 diabetes and other chronic conditions like thalassemia. Under the care of their multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, I received comprehensive treatment, regular check-ups, and invaluable support. These visits, scheduled every one to three months, allowed me to monitor my treatment protocol, glucose levels, self-management skills, dietary habits, and growth status.
                
                The Center not only assisted me but also provided my family with a thorough understanding of the disease, from administering insulin injections three times a day to conducting blood sugar tests before every meal. Additionally, I thrived in the center's welcoming and supportive environment, where I shared my experiences and concerns during our regular medical visits.
                
                Living with diabetes is a journey fraught with challenges, it has sculpted me into a resilient individual, equipped with the fortitude to surmount any obstacle in pursuit of greatness.
                So as you embark on your own journey, remember this: challenges may arise, but they are mere stepping stones on the path to greatness. Celebrate your victories, and always remember to be proud  of who you are.The world is waiting for Us & We have the power to make a difference.</p>

            <h1>Reminder</h1>
            <p> On the off chance that you encounter symptoms of increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight reduction, increased appetite, and feel a tingling sensation in your hands or feet, chances are that you are a diabetic. Find out by the following diabetes tests.
                The Symptoms and effects of diabetes show up all of a sudden and are frequently the explanation behind checking glucose levels. Since the symptoms of diabetes and prediabetes appear more gradually, the side effects may not be clear to us. However, The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has prescribed some particular screening rules for the accompanying individuals:
                Individuals aged 45 and above are encouraged to get a blood sugar screening, and if results are normal, he is to be screened in every 3 years.
                Any individual with a body mass index higher than 25, paying little respect to age, pertaining to extra risk components like, hypertension, an inactive way of life, someone who has been diagnosed with PCOS, having delivered an infant who measured more than 9 pounds, a crisp background marked by diabetes in pregnancy, extremely high cholesterol levels, a past filled with coronary illness, and having a relative with diabetes. All top test for diabetes mentioned here.
                Top Tests for Diabetes
                HbA1C:
                This blood test shows your normal glucose level for as long as a few months. It quantifies the rate of glucose connected to haemoglobin and the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. The higher the glucose levels, the more haemoglobin one has with sugar attached to it. An A1C level of 6.5 percent or higher on two separate tests shows that you have diabetes. An A1C somewhere around 5.7 and 6.4 percent demonstrates prediabetes. Beneath 5.7 is viewed as normal.
                Fasting Blood Sugar Test:
                In this test your blood sample will be collected after you have observed an overnight fast. A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. If it’s 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes.
                A Complete Blood Count (CBC):
                This is a blood test used to evaluate an individual’s overall health and discover a wide range of disorders, ranging from anemia, to leukemia.
                The CBC test measures several components and features of one’s blood, that typically includes Oxygen carrying Red blood cells, White blood cells, Hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen, Hematocrit, the proportion of plasma in an individual’s blood and Platelets, that help with clotting blood.
                Any abnormal increases or decreases in these cell counts as revealed in a CBC test may indicate that one might have an underlying medical condition that requires to be diagnosed further.
                Post Prandial Glucose Test (PPBS):
                This is a blood glucose test that decides the measure of a particular type of sugar, named as glucose. In this test Glucose is measured in the blood particularly after a meal.
                Ordinarily, blood glucose levels elevate marginally after eating a meal. This expansion causes the pancreas to discharge insulin, which helps the body in expelling glucose from the blood and storing it for providing vital energy to the body. Individuals with diabetes may not create or react legitimately to insulin, which increases their blood glucose levels. High blood glucose levels can drastically  harm the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and veins.
                A 2-hour PPBS test measures blood glucose precisely 2 hours in the wake of eating a meal. By this point glucose has generally retreated down in healthy individuals, yet it might in any case be raised in individuals with diabetes. Subsequently, it serves as a trial for whether an individual may have diabetes, or of whether an individual who has diabetes is effectively controlling their blood glucose levels.
                Cholesterol Test:
                Diabetes drastically increases the risk of heart disease in an individual, which makes it inevitable for them to have a blood test to screen their cholesterol levels more frequently; in the off chance their cholesterol levels are high.</p>
